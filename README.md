## Getting Started

If you're familiar with React Native already, you won't find any `ios` or `android` directories in this project, just JavaScript. Once this installation is done, there are some commands you can run in the project directory:

#### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `./node_modules/.bin/react-native run-android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).

#### `npm run eject`

This will start the process of "ejecting" from Create React Native App's build scripts. You'll be asked a couple of questions about how you'd like to build your project.

**Warning:** Running eject is a **permanent** action. Please use a version control system, such as git, so you can revert back if necessary. An ejected app will require you to have an [Xcode and/or Android Studio environment](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) set up.

## Philosophy

* **Minimal "Time to Hello World"**: Create React Native App should reduce the setup time it takes to try building a mobile app to the absolute minimum, ideally on par with React web development (especially as seen with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)).
* **Develop on Your Device**: It should be easy to develop on a physical device when you want to test how your app feels and responds to inputs.
* **One Build Tool**: If you just want to get started with React Native, you shouldn't need to install Xcode, Android Studio, NDKs, or mess with environment variables.
* **No Lock-In**: You can always "eject" to your own build setup if you need to write custom native code or modify how your app is built.

## Support and Contact

If you're having issues with Create React Native App, please make sure:

If you've checked the documentation and currently open issues, please either open a new GitHub issue, [find @dika10sune on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dika10sune), or ping `dikaiosune` on [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/)'s #react-native channel on Discord. **Please do not DM or email project maintainers directly**, as it's very important that support takes place in public locations where others can benefit from the conversation.

## FAQs

### What API specification should I be looking at while developing?

Apps made with Create React Native App support everything in the Components and APIs sections of the [React Native Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

Apps made with Create React Native App also support most of the JavaScript-to-Native APIs provided by the [Expo SDK](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/index.html), since they are loaded by the Expo app.

### What are the limitations of Create React Native App?

The main limitation of a Create React Native App project is that it must be written in pure JavaScript and not have any dependencies which rely on custom native code (i.e. ones which require running `react-native link` to work). This allows the projects to load directly on a phone without native compilation, and also means that it's not necessary to install or use Android Studio or Xcode.

### How do I get my app into the Play Store/App Store?

If you need to build IPAs and APKs for publishing to the App Store and/or Play Store, you can either eject (see above guide) and build them yourself using Xcode and Android Studio, or you can use a service like [Expo's standalone app builds](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v13.0.0/guides/building-standalone-apps.html) to publish your pure JS app.
